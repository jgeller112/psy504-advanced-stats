### Articles

**The following article uses the R package brms (which is a Bayesian data analysis package). While there are differences between frequenist and Bayesian statsitics, you can use brms to fit models equivalent to frequentist statistics by using weakly informative priors--which is what we will be doing. I hope you notice that the output from brms is very similar to lm outputs you have seen before. However, there are no p-values so it is common to only look at the 95% CIs to determine significance.
