#install_miniconda()
use_python("/Users/jasongeller/Library/r-miniconda-arm64/envs/r-reticulate/bin/python", required = TRUE)

```

## Formatting 

# Header 1
Using a single # gives you a really large header!

## Header 2
Using two gives you a slightly smaller header!

### Header 3
...and on

#### Header 4
...and on

##### Header 5
...and on

##  Lists

You may also want to use a bulleted list!

- just
- like
- this
- one

Or maybe an ordered list!

1. like
2. this
3. one

To emphasize your point you might want to use *italics* or **bold**. 

To have something appear as code (using a monospace font), surround everything that is code with ticks \`like this\`, so that it shows up `like this`.

If you're the math-y type, you will be happy to know that you can write LaTeX in .qmd files as well! For a full line formula, use two \$\$ dollar signs at the begining and end of your LaTeX:

```
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x + 2y
$$
```

will appear as 
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x + 2y
$$

For in-line LaTeX just use one \$ in your text. For example, $x + \beta$

You may also want to put a [link](https://www.google.com) to a website for reference. Or, insert an image!

## Callout Blocks
One really cool thing about markdown documents like Quarto is that you can use a **callout block**. These are helpful for two reasons:

- call-out blocks highlight sections of text that interrupt the flow of your regular text. Maybe it's a definition, a warning, or a sidenote
- when rendering your document to HTML, callout blocks are interactive and can be collapsed and opened.

## My First Callout Block!
Say things here

## Callout Blocks

- IF you're rendering to HTML (PDFs are not interactive and therefore cannot collapse callout blocks)

- Use the `collapse="true"` argument in a callout to make the callout block not show unless the user clicks on it.

::: {.callout-warning, collapse=TRUE}
## Question
- We want to *decrease* $f$, so what should we do to $x$ and $y$?
- Which one should we decrease more? $x$ or $y$?
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Answer
We should *decrease* both $x$ and $y$, and we should decrease $y$ more becasue it has a bigger impact than $x$ at this specific point $(2,3)$.

It turns out that we'll take a step in the direction $-\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}$!

But we'll save the details for CPSC 393...

## Code Blocks
One of the most useful things about markdown documents like this is that you can intersperse your writing with code!

For example, this R code:

```{r}
# reticulate library allows you to run both
# R and python in the same .qmd
# file. Normally you do not 
# need this
library(reticulate)
library(ggplot2)
y <- 10
x <- y + 5

print(x,y)
```

or this python code:

```{python}
x = 10
y = 2
print(x + y)
```

## Notes

- Generally all the code runs

- One option is to use the `eval: false` argument when setting up your codeblock:

```{python}
#| eval: false
print("Don't Run Me")
```

```{python}
#| eval: true
print("Do Run Me")
```

- This is useful for showing someone what code you used without needing to show them the output or comupute the code
